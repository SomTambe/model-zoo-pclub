# Model-Zoo

Contains all the models made during the PClub Model Zoo summer project (and also their respective writeups).

List of models added -

- [Resnet](./resnet) [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf)
- [3D-GAN](./3D-GAN_PyTorch) [(paper)](http://3dgan.csail.mit.edu/papers/3dgan_nips.pdf)
- [StarGAN](./StarGAN_PyTorch) [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09020)
- [Adversarial Autoencoder](./AAE_PyTorch) [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05644)
  
These are all the models. In any case if I used any references, I have mentioned them (also for some of them the mentioning is in progress). The project repo can be found [here](https://github.com/pclubiitk/model-zoo).
